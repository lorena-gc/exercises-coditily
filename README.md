# Exercises - Codility

## Codility Exercise Solutions in Java

This project contains my solutions to exercises proposed by the Codility platform, using the Java programming language.

The goal of this repository is to consolidate the knowledge acquired in Java and to practice solving algorithmic and structural problems.

Each exercise is organized into specific directories, making it easier to navigate and understand the solutions.
